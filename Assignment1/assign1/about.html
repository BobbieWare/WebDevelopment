                <p>Writing some of the SQL code was tricky while not having access to </p>

                <p>What would you like to do better next time?</p>
                <p>I feel that I could have used more includes and having less code written more then once.</p>
                <p>What references/sources you have used to help you learn how to create your website?</p>
                <p>Personal reference, a lead developer with lots of experience,  and gave me lots of advice. </p>
                <p>What you have learnt along the way? </p>
